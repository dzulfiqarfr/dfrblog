Currently, I analyze data and make charts to tell\r\n            stories at Katadata, a\r\n            Central Jakarta-based media focusing on economic news. I\r\n            cover various datasets, ranging from cooking\r\n            oil prices to the\r\n            mood of songs on Spotify.\r\n            Prior to this, I covered business and economic news for\r\n            The Jakarta Post, a\r\n            leading English-speaking media based in Central Jakarta,\r\n            between October 2019 and\r\n            March 2022.\r\n            I also take side gigs. My latest was analyzing a survey\r\n            on digital skills of the youth in Southeast Asia for LOKA Group, a\r\n            nonprofit research consultancy—which served the ASEAN\r\n            Foundation as the client in this project.
