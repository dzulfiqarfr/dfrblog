# dfrblog

This is a repo for my personal website that I built using the [**distill**](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) package in R. Although the repoâ€™s name is dfrblog, the website integrates my personal information page (which uses the [**postcards**](https://github.com/seankross/postcards) package), blog and portfolio.

Previously, I blogged on [Medium](https://dzulfiqarfr.medium.com/).
