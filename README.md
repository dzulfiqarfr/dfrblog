# dfrblog

This is a repo for my personal website that I built using the [**distill**](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/){target=“_blank”} package in R. Although the repo’s name is dfrblog, the website integrates my personal information page (which uses the [**postcards**](https://github.com/seankross/postcards){target=“_blank”} package), blog and portfolio.
