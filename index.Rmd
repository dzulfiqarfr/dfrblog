## Data journalist

Hi! Currently, I analyze data and make charts to tell stories at [Katadata, a Central Jakarta-based media focusing on economic news](https://katadata.co.id/analisisdata). I cover various datasets, ranging from [cooking oil prices](https://katadata.co.id/ariayudhistira/analisisdata/62592d926bc52/daerah-mana-paling-tertekan-lonjakan-harga-minyak-goreng) to [the mood of songs on Spotify](https://katadata.co.id/ariayudhistira/analisisdata/6287a5383c274/selera-musik-di-indonesia-cenderung-lagu-sedih).

Prior to this, I covered business and economic news for [The Jakarta Post, a leading English-speaking media based in Central Jakarta](https://thejakartapost.com), between <time datetime="2019-10">October 2019</time> and <time datetime="2022-03">March 2022</time>.

I also take side gigs. My latest was analyzing a survey on digital skills of the youth in Southeast Asia for [LOKA Group, a nonprofit research consultancy](https://www.instagram.com/ceritaloka/)—which served the ASEAN Foundation as the client in this project. I worked on this project between <time datetime="2021-10">October 2021</time> and <time datetime="2022-04">April 2022</time>.

I have given virtual talks about data journalism to a summer course at Universitas Diponegoro, a student publication at Universitas Pelita Harapan and a student executive body at Universitas Indonesia.

Why, yes, I code—mostly in R.
